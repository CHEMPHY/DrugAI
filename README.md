# DrugAI-Gen.py (LSTM model)
Generator script for creating drug like molecule using LSTM model.

# DrugAI-GAN.py (GAN model)
This is my own experiments with Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) for drug like molecule generation. Teaching GAN in discrete dataset is hard and also I learned to code GAN from internet so would not gurantee any acurracy of the results or the code.

# Another Dataset for Generation
Because I seen a increase in interest for **DrugAI-Gen.py**; for programmers I have added another dataset *sms.tsv*. It contains SMS spams. Try to use it for generating *Spam's* and *Ham's*.
